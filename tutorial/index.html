    <h2>What is Hazelcast?</h2>
    <p>Hazelcast is an in-memory data grid technology. By using Hazelcast, in-memory distributed data structures can be easily implemented. This kind of structures are very useful for sharing key data among several hosts, among other uses.</p>
    <p>The example in this template implements a server and a client that share an IMap (distributed map). This map will represent a shopping list. One instance, aka the mother, can add and remove items from the list. The other instance, aka the child, can only read the elements in the list.</p>
    <p>Let's see how this is implemented.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Hazelcast Server</h2>
    <p>In order to create an IMap, a Hazelcast instance must be created first:</p>
    <pre><code>
      val hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(new Config())
    </code></pre>
    <p>Afterwards, an IMap named "shoppingList" is created. This map contains the name of the item of the shopping-list and the number of items of that type:</p>
    <pre><code>
      val shoppingList = hazelcastInstance.getMap[String, Int]("shoppingList")
    </code></pre>
    <p>The logic for adding new items to the map is implemented in the following piece of code:</p>
    <pre><code>
      shoppingList.put(item, amount)
    </code></pre>
    <p>For removing items from the list, the following code is used:</p>
    <pre><code>
      shoppingList.remove(item)
    </code></pre>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Hazelcast Client</h2>
    <p>In order to obtain an IMap, a Hazelcast client instance must be created first:</p>
    <pre><code>
      val hazelcastClient = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(new ClientConfig())
    </code></pre>
    <p>For obtaining the map, the next action is performed:</p>
    <pre><code>
      val shoppingList = hazelcastClient.getMap[String, Int]("shoppingList")
    </code></pre>
    <p>Finally, the items of the map can be extracted by means of their keys and corresponding values.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>How can I test it?</h2>
    <p>Two APIs have been created for testing the functionality of the example: MomApi and ChildApi.</p>
    <p>For simulating the behaviour of the child and reading the shopping list, you can access to the URL 0.0.0.0:6000/list</p>
    <p>For simulating the addition of an element (done by the mother instance), a POST request must be performed. For example, if you want to add three oranges, you should send a POST request to 0.0.0.0:5000/list/orange?n=3</p>
    <p>For simulating the removal of all the items of a product (all oranges, all apples...), a DELETE request must be performed to 0.0.0.0:5000/list/product_name, where product_name is substituted by the name of the product (apple, orange...)</p>
